## [Project 1: Utilizing Weak Supervision with Snorkel to Build a Training Set (NASA)](https://github.com/ARalevski/nasa_petal_snorkel)
- Utilized the [Snorkel system](https://snorkel.ai/) to build a training set of labeled biomimicry papers. 
- Labeling our data by hand was prohibitively slow, so we turned to a weak supervision approach using labeling functions (LFs) in Snorkel.
- LFs are noisy, programmatic rules and heuristics that assign labels to unlabeled training data. 
- We successfully trained a classifier that could predict what label a certain biomimicry paper should receive with 95% accuracy.

## [Project 2: Utilizing SciBERT for binary classification of biomimicry papers (NASA)](https://github.com/ARalevski/nasa_petal_scibert)
- Utilized SciBERT to determine to mine the scientific literature and determine whether a paper was biomimetic (Y/N).
- Model achieved a 0.98 AUC score and 91% accuracy rate with minimal tuning.


## [Project 3: Employee Retention (Personal Project)](https://github.com/ARalevski/which_employees_leave)
- Generated a machine learning model that predicts which employees are most likely to leave a company.
- Optimized Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regressors, and Boosted Trees using GridsearchCV to determine the best model.
- The model achieved a 0.98 AUC score and 91% accuracy rate with minimal tuning.
