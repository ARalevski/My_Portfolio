## [Project 1: Utilizing Weak Supervision with Snorkel to Build a Training Set (NASA)](https://github.com/ARalevski/nasa_petal_snorkel)
- Utilized the [Snorkel system](https://snorkel.ai/) to build a training set of labeled biomimicry papers. 
- Labeling our data by hand was prohibitively slow, so we turned to a weak supervision approach using labeling functions (LFs) in Snorkel.
- LFs are noisy, programmatic rules and heuristics that assign labels to unlabeled training data. 
- We successfully trained a classifier that could predict what label a certain biomimicry paper should receive with 95% accuracy.

  <figcaption> An overview of the Snorkel system. (1) Subject matter experts (SME) users write labeling functions (LFs) that express weak supervision sources like distant supervision, patterns, and heuristics. (2) Snorkel applies the LFs over unlabeled data and learns a generative model to combine the LFs' outputs into probabilistic labels. (3) Snorkel uses these labels to train a discriminative classification model, such as a deep neural network. Adapted from Ratner et. al (2017). </a>

## [Project 2: Utilizing SciBERT for binary classification of biomimicry papers (NASA)](https://github.com/ARalevski/nasa_petal_scibert)
- Utilized SciBERT to determine whether a paper would qualify as 'biomimetic' (Y/N).
- Model achieved a XX AUC score and XX% accuracy.


## [Project 3: Employee Retention (Personal Project)](https://github.com/ARalevski/which_employees_leave)
- Generated a machine learning model that predicts which employees are most likely to leave a company.
- Optimized Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regressors, and Boosted Trees using GridsearchCV to determine the best model.
- The winning Random Forest model achieved a 0.99 AUC score and 91% accuracy rate with minimal tuning.
