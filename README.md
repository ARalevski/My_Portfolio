## [Project 1: Utilizing Weak Supervision to Expand Training Data (NASA)](https://github.com/ARalevski/nasa_petal_snorkel)
- Utilized the [Snorkel machine learning model](https://snorkel.ai/) to label biomimicry papers.
- Snorkel uses weak supervision to label large amounts of training data using programmatic labeling functions based on keyword 'rules'.

## [Project 2: Utilizing SciBERT for binary classification of biomimicry papers (NASA)](https://github.com/ARalevski/nasa_petal_scibert)
- Utilized SciBERT to determine to mine the scientific literature and determine whether a paper was biomimetic.
- 


## [Project 3: Employee Retention (Personal Project)](https://github.com/ARalevski/which_employees_leave)
- XXX
- Optimized Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regressors, and Boosted Trees using GridsearchCV to determine the best model.
