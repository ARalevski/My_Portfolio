## [Project 1: Utilizing Weak Supervision to Expand Training Data (NASA)](https://github.com/ARalevski/nasa_petal_snorkel)
- Utilized the [Snorkel system](https://snorkel.ai/) to build a training set of labeled biomimicry papers. 
• Labeling our data by hand was prohibitively slow, so we turned to a weak supervision approach using labeling functions (LFs) in Snorkel.
• LFs are noisy, programmatic rules and heuristics that assign labels to unlabeled training data. 
• We successfully trained a classifier that could predict what label a certain biomimicry paper should receive with 95% accuracy.

## [Project 2: Utilizing SciBERT for binary classification of biomimicry papers (NASA)](https://github.com/ARalevski/nasa_petal_scibert)
- Utilized SciBERT to determine to mine the scientific literature and determine whether a paper was biomimetic.
- 


## [Project 3: Employee Retention (Personal Project)](https://github.com/ARalevski/which_employees_leave)
- Machine learning model that predicts which employees are most likely to leave a company.
- Optimized Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regressors, and Boosted Trees using GridsearchCV to determine the best model.
- Model achieved 91% accuracy with minimal tuning.
